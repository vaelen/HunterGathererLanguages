This application is used to track linguistic information about
hunter gatherer languages.

Before running the application you will need to place a valid DataSource.groovy file in the grails-app/conf/ directory.

WARNING WARNING WARNING: do *NOT* try to run grails without a valid
DataSource.groovy file -- it will overwrite many source files in bad
ways.

Also, the mail.jar that ships with grails can cause conflicts with the one that ships with tomcat.  To fix these problems, run this command after compiling the app but before creating the war file (replace 1.2.0.RC2 with the version of grails you are using):

	rm `~/.grails/1.2.0.RC2/projects/HunterGathererLanguages -name mail.jar`

When configuring the database, be sure to use UTF-8.  Using a connection string like the following one should accomplish this for MySQL:

	jdbc:mysql://servername.example.com/hunter_gatherer?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8

Also, you need to set the Hibernate dialect in your DataSource.groovy file to this value so that tables are created with a UTF-8 character set:

	dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5UTF8InnoDBDialect

For more info about Grails:
---------------------------
See "Groovy and Grails Recipes".  This is basically the example application
from the book.  What we present to the user is basically the admin screen --
"normally" there is another nicer level on top.

See the following web page for a quick start:
  http://www.grails.org/Quick+Start

Problem with sending email when trying to sign up for account:
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a LAITS problem with their server not accepting connections from our
app.  Email them and they'll fix it.  Can also create accounts manually from
Pattie's admin account. (User admin piece is a plugin.)

Running development vs. production:
-----------------------------------
To run in development, cd to grails-app and then execute `grails run-war'.
This starts up a web server and prints out is a URL that you connect to in
your browser.

run-app vs. run-war:
-- run-war compiles everything once then runs
-- run-app does the same but also tries to recompile on the fly (problem is
   that it's too eager and recompiles even if you haven't changed anything)

Pushing to production:
----------------------
1. Run `grails make-war' -- creates a WAR file with a version number attached
2. Symlink the .war file to releases/HunterGathererLanguages.war
3. Run `make-gz' script -- creates .tar.gz file and copies it to proper place
4. Email LAITS (Nick ...) and tell him that a new file has been dropped
5. He will promote it to where it needs to go

Note about developers:
----------------------

  1. Andrew Young
  2. Simon Greenhill
  3. Mike Speriosu (but didn't actually commit anything)

About Grails versions:
----------------------

This was created using Grails 1.2.0.RC2.  There are a lot of dependencies
that are specified in `application.properties'.  In theory,

(a) it should be possible to use the released Grails 1.2.0 (by changing the
    applications.properties file)

(b) it should be possible to upgrade to the latest Grails by running
    `grails upgrade', but Mike had problems getting this working


The different servers:
----------------------

-- The front end runs on ...
-- The back end runs on ...

Creating the database:
----------------------

The first time you run Grails against a brand-new database (created by
LAITS) when you run in production mode (i.e. `grails run-war' with some
flag to run in production mode), Grails creates the tables in the database.

About filtering (from Andrew):
------------------------------

"Filtering" shows search criteria for limiting the display of various
lists of stuff.  For example, in LexicalDataController:

http://github.com/vaelen/HunterGathererLanguages/blob/master/grails-app/controllers/LexicalFeatureController.groovy

In this controller, the user can filter by English Headword, Spanish
Headword, Portuguese Headword, French Headword, Latin Headword, Case
Study Region, Semantic Field, Category, Part of Speech, and Export Set.

The code in Controller.groovy is the default implementation, and these
methods should then be overridden by controllers that need to add
filtering, such as LexicalFeatureController.

It looks like Simon duplicated a lot of the code into the individual
controllers that shouldn't need to be there.  I don't know why that was
done, but Simon should be able to tell us.

Here you can see which developer wrote each line of code in the file:

http://github.com/vaelen/HunterGathererLanguages/blame/master/grails-app/controllers/LexicalFeatureController.groovy

This next link is the file as I originally wrote it.  You'll notice
that only getFilterList() and doFilter() are overridden, NOT filter(),
parseFilter(), and list().  Duplicating these methods into each controller
defeats the purpose of putting the methods in Controller.groovy to begin
with, so I'm not sure why Simon did this.

http://github.com/vaelen/HunterGathererLanguages/blob/5b846e15c1b512983c7e4b64b7180815f2b11e41/grails-app/controllers/LexicalFeatureController.groovy

The data returned by getFilterList() and doFilter() is then used by the
list.gsp view, which displays the various text fields and select fields
that handle the filtering.

Let me know if this didn't answer your question.
