<p class="p1">1) The front end is in Groovy, which seems to be a problem in that most people we've talked to are not familiar with it. One thing we'd really like to do if possible is to migrate the front end to something more generic and widely known, assuming this can be done within a reasonable time frame. In other words, if we could just get this thing to a point where further development was relatively straightforward, we'd be in pretty good shape.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">2) Groovy documentation (links from Andrew):</p>
<p class="p1">A book:</p>

<p class="p1">3) Here is the URL for the database:<span class="s3"> <a href="http://tomcat.la.utexas.edu:8080/HunterGathererLanguages/"><span class="s4">http://tomcat.la.utexas.edu:8080/HunterGathererLanguages/</span></a></span>. There've been some problems with setting up user ids and passwords, but everyone should be able to use the ones Ben and Mike have for now.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">4) As for accessing the programming side of things - here's some info (from Simon Greenhill, a developer in New Zealand who worked on it for a period earlier this spring after Andrew):</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The site is developed using the Grails framework - it's a java clone of the Ruby on Rails rapid web development platform. To get the code you'll need to check it out of the public git repository here:</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><a href="http://github.com/vaelen/HunterGathererLanguages">http://github.com/vaelen/HunterGathererLanguages<span class="s5"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">It's deployed on the server by compiling it to a "war" archive and then one of the friendly people at LA support will load it into a tomcat instance and restart the server. Basically, you make changes to the code, commit them to the repository, run "grails war" to compile the website, into ./target/HunterGathererLanguages-0.2.6.war, copy that into ./releases, rename it to "HunterGathererLanguages.war" (or else the "-0.2.6" junk will turn up in the URLS), and run the script make-gz in that directory and upload things to file.laits.utexas.edu:/mnt/projects/hunter-gatherer_languages/hunter_gatherer/.</p>
<p class="p4">The MySQL database is on a different server, <a href="http://mysql.laits.utexas.edu/"><span class="s4">mysql.laits.utexas.edu</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Andrew, Mike, and Ben all have the file with the production database password in it; I can also send this around if needed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The LAITS people can set up passwords and so forth if needed (I can email them and ask them to do this).</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">OMITTED HERE: A section giving the password for accessing the MySQL part of the database through phpmyadmin using this URL:</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><a href="https://mysql.laits.utexas.edu/phpmyadmin">https://mysql.laits.utexas.edu/phpmyadmin<span class="s5"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The section is in a separate file called `mysql-database-phpmyadmin-password.txt'.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">If you are not using phpmyadmin, whatever you use MUST be run from a <a href="http://laits.utexas.edu/"><span class="s4">laits.utexas.edu</span></a> address!</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">If you are using a shell, you will not be able to connect to <a href="http://mysql.laits.utexas.edu/"><span class="s4">mysql.laits.utexas.edu</span></a> directly, but will need to ssh into <a href="http://file.laits.utexas.edu/"><span class="s4">file.laits.utexas.edu</span></a> first!</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">php and related files in /mnt/projects/hunter-gatherer_languages/ (for development, not the actual live site).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">live version in /mnt/www/&lt;<a href="http://laits.utexas.edu/"><span class="s5">http://laits.utexas.edu/</span></a>&gt;<a href="http://laits.utexas.edu/"><span class="s5">laits.utexas.edu/</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">If you're off campus, you probably need to vpn to access</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><a href="http://directory.laits.utexas.edu/">directory.laits.utexas.edu</a></span>, this is because a lot of our servers are only</p>
<p class="p4">accessible from campus addresses.</p>
<p class="p1">5) And finally, here's a problem Mike encountered - this is the kind of thing we'll need to troubleshoot; I'm sure Andrew will be able to help here:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The main problem seems to be that the system was built with an old version of Grails (1.2.0 according to Andrew), which comes with dozens of external code libraries in the form of JAR files, each of which sits in a particular directory (some sharing certain directories, others elsewhere). I have now tried at least five different versions of Grails (including three different releases of 1.2.0, called 1.2.0, 1.2.0-RC1 and 1.2.0-RC2), and none of them seems to have the right set of libraries in the right places, according to what the existing code wants. To give just one example, the project is looking for GRAILS_HOME/ant/lib/ant.jar within the Grails directory, whereas the current version of Grails has the equivalent file in GRAILS_HOME/lib/ant-1.7.1.jar. Different versions of Grails find this file, but miss others. While I can find this probably-correct-file-with-different-name-and-location for some of the files it wants, I cannot find it for others. There is also a "grails upgrade" command that comes with the current version of Grails (1.3.1) which is supposed to update any Grails project built with an old version so that it works with the new version. This did not work either; there were still plenty of JAR files the project couldn't find. My best guess as to what's going on here is that an early version of Grails was initially used, with some other libraries added/moved manually in various places.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">6) I've attached a page of early database description notes (drawn up by Claire) - this may be useful to see how we've envisioned the structure, although much of this is already incorporated into the database as it stands now. Claire noticed when looking into the phpmyadmin interface recently that the names are sometimes different here from the site, but it should be fairly straightforward.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">7) Here are some of the current general priorities we had talked about some time ago with Mike:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">.removal of the delete button for the feature category table [or some</p>
<p class="p1">way to check that deleting an item won't screw up other items in the</p>
<p class="p1">db]</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">. a way to back up the SQL tables (save a copy that I can grab off the</p>
<p class="p1">server or have it compressed and emailed, or something).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">. a way to prevent certain data from being publicly viewable. If this</p>
<p class="p1">is not easy, then we would like to make the entire database not</p>
<p class="p1">viewable without a login at this stage, so that we can put up data</p>
<p class="p1">from language centres which we still need to negotiate permissions</p>
<p class="p1">for.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">. a script that would populate a table with all the current features</p>
<p class="p1">for a given language.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">. editable table views of the lexical, demographic and ethnographic information</p>
<p class="p1">so that we can fill in cells quickly. THis has been done with the</p>
<p class="p1">cognate coding view.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">- More filters; more user-friendly interface generally</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">- Diacritics in database - need to fix code so they don't convert to non-diacritics when edited</p>
<p class="p4">- Tables and code for bulk data entry / importing in general</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">- Next/previous entry button in individual entry view</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s6">-</span> mapping module</p>
