This contains controllers that act as an interface between the database and
the views.  The 'scaffolding = true' statement causes the code in
`scaffolding' to be automatically interpolated into the class at runtime.

Note that the code that implements controllers is in three different
directories:

1. grails-app/controllers
2. src/groovy (for base classes)
3. src/templates/scaffolding (for Controller.groovy, which gets textually
   inserted into all classes at runtime)
