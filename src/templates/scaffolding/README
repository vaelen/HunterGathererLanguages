The files in this directory are used to add code to each controller at
runtime if the controller defines a variable named "scaffolding" that is
set to true.

The scaffolding code does all the hard work, generating the gui and working
with the data in the database.

The way that the code is interpolated into the class is literally appending
the code textually to the beginning of the class.  The code like this:

<%=packageName ? "package ${packageName}\n\n" : ""%>class ${className}Controller {

adds Groovy code to specify the name of the package at runtime. (The
scaffolding code is run through a preprocessor, the same one that processes
GSP files.)

The problem is that expressions like ${packageName} are interpreted by the
preprocessor so if you need a $[..} in your code you need to escape it as
follows:

... \${...}

Note that if a bare word follows the $ this isn't necessary.
